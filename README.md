   - I want to be able to control the power button so I can experience the interactive nature of the game.
    - I want to be able to control the start button so as to begin when I am ready.

## Design
The design is a reflection of the original game.

### Fonts
The font Orbitron was used as the primary font so as to give a modern/space feel that co-ordinates with the flashing lights and sounds.

### Colour
* The main header and footer are black with contrastin white text. The comment that is the "catch phase" of the game is highlighted in neon pink.
* The Simon border for the padding is a strong balck that opposes the primary colours of the game and matches the header and footer.
* The pads are the four primary colours and match the original game.
* Inner circle - This is where the control buttons are. It is black which gives the illusion of a physical object like the original game and contrast against the control buttons.
* Start button/Power Button - Faded green colour but once clicked both are highlighted.
* Strict Slider - this is labelled and white. Once turned on it becomes red which reflects the challenge that it represents.
* Game-info button - A neon pink that stands out, adds to the retro feel that this game represents and matches with the intriging comment.

### Styling
The styling is in line with the original game and incorporates flashing and audio to make the game even more engageing.


## Features
### Existing Features
#### Feature 1
_Dashboard:_
* This is a __interactive__ dashboard which welcomes the user with striking imagery that allows for an intuitive feel for the game.



#### Feature 2
_Game Information modal:_
* Clear access to the information about "How to play" is shown with a modal button.
* This is a fixed modal in bright pink to catch the users attention.


#### Feature 3
_Coloured Pads:_
* The four pads are faded and only light up once the power button has been clicked.
* The pads are primarily where the user interacts with the game.
* You can only click the pads when it is the players turn.


#### Feature 4
_Power and Start button:_
* The power button must be clicked before the start button and this has been carefully programmed to follow this sequence.
* Once the power button has been clicked the pads light up and the score board reflects that the power is on.
* Once the start button is pressed the game reacts by fading the pad lights and the score board reflects the beginning of the game
by showing zero.

#### Feature 5
_Strict Slider:_
* This is slider button is off by default and when slide on, it reflects this through a colour change.

#### Feature 7
_Scoreboard:_
* Once the page is loaded the score board will be empty.
* With the power button clicked it will show "--"
* Once start is clicked the scoreboard begins at "0"

#### Feature 8
_Header & Footer:_
* Footer copyrighting the design.
* Navigation bar boldy showing the name of the game and an intriging comment that hints at the games nature.

### Features to implement in the Future
* A range of levels including rotation of the pads to tailor for more abilities.
* Prompting modals that appear subtly as you hover over buttons to inform the player as they go.
* An optional trial game to allow new players to test it out before commiting to a game.
* A follow up message that challenges the player to another game.
* A functional calender keeping track of the players score over the course of time. This prompts the player to competively beat their previous scores.
