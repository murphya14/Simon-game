## Features
### Existing Features
#### Feature 1
_Navigation Bar:_
This is a __responsive__ navigation bar which allows the user to navigate easily and access the information
which they require by clicking links. This enhances the User Interface. For mobile devices, this becomes a 'select' dropdown menu
which saves real estate for the smaller screen. The logo is in the navigation bar and the yellow colour gives a sense of vibrancy reflecting the nature of the business.
Social media links are highlighted.

#### Feature 2
_Footer:_
This is a fixed footer showing a copyright as well as a link to social media links.
There is a "Back to the top" button and this allows visitors to click it and return to the top of the page for ease of navigation.

#### Feature 3
_Social Media Icons:_ These are fixed iconsin both the navigation bar and footer. They are opposing colours to catch the attention of customers
The icons are sourced from Font Awesome. They change colour when the mouse hovers over them which creates an engaging customer experience.
The active page is highlighted by a slate gray colour to aid navigation.

#### Feature 4
_Black and white Image:_
Each page has a black and white image below the navigation bar to convey a positive emotive response from the user.
On each page the signature name of LN Fitness is printed across the image in bright green. Each page benefits from a new image to keep the customer engaged and convey the service provided.
With responsive design, the image is not shown, however, the signature name is to encourage brand recognition.

#### Feature 5
_Tailored program link:_ This is located on the 'Home' page and links to the 'Personal Training'
page. It is to attract customers to the promotion of a free consultation and a
__call to action button__. The word "free" is highlighted to draw attention to the offer.

#### Feature 6
_Embedded Video:_ Located on the 'Group Training' page. The user can play and pause with a click. With responsive design, this becomes a button that becomes an external page so the user is not taken away from LN Fitness website.


#### Feature 7
_Get in touch link:_ Link on each page (except home) and a __call to action__ which directs the customer to the Get in Touch page. Located at the end of the page.


#### Feature 8
_Get in touch:_ This is a form, allowing visitors to send their enquiry directly to
the fitness expert. Name, email, contact number and message must be filled. All fields are required
and a valid email address must be used. The bottom of the page contains a Send Button. Included in the form is a box that can be ticked to opt in to emails regarding the latest offers.
This can potentially increase the customer base and allows for effective marketing.

#### Fearure 11
_Font and colours_ A transitioning gray to white background was chosen with the text in black.
This was to convey the clean and simple service that is being provided. The colours compliment the black and white photos while highlighting the energetic and vibrancy nature of the navigation bar (yellow), signiture text (bright green) and highlighted text (white or marigold)
which is used to create a healthy vibrancy to the website.
