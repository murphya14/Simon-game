# Simon Game  

https://github.com/murphya14/Simon-game.git





This is an Interactive Frontend website for an engaging memory game, The Simon Game.
The purpose of this website is to provide a challeging game that gives an energetic User Interface and captures the attention of the player. 
This game has stood the test of time and has been a popular choice for over 40 years! 


This is a game that appeals to __all ages__. There is the 
option of a more challenging game by using the __Strict Mode__ setting. 
The aim of this website is to provide an energetic game that is pleasing visually and audibly.

This is a B2C website which triggers emotive response through 
testimonials, images, video clips and ease of contact in order to create customers.
Pricing is conveyed clearly with a clear and simple method to contact the Business directly. In addition 
to this, there is an offer of a free consultation for the most expensive 
package which is the tailored programs. This offers an incentive for potential customers. 

## UX Design

The purpose of this website is mainly to attract new customers and make them aware of the current offer (Free Consultation for the Personal Training Package.)
It is a source of information for current customers as it provides social media
links, a group fitness timetable, details on classes and a video of the classes.
Customers can find out more about the founders background as well as what's involved in Personal Training.
They have the ability to contact the Business and can tick the box to be sent any customer offers.
The content is laid out to allow the customer navigate easily to 
find the information which they require. This includes a 'back-to-top' button and prompting links. 

__The target customer has the following qualities:__
* Health orientated/ Looking to establish fitness goals

User story:__

## Features
### Existing Features 
#### Feature 1 
_Navigation Bar:_
This is a __responsive__ navigation bar which allows the user to navigate easily and access the information 
which they require by clicking links. This enhances the User Interface. For mobile devices, this becomes a 'select' dropdown menu
which saves real estate for the smaller screen. The logo is in the navigation bar and the yellow colour gives a sense of vibrancy reflecting the nature of the business.
Social media links are highlighted.

#### Feature 2
_Footer:_
This is a fixed footer showing a copyright as well as a link to social media links.
There is a "Back to the top" button and this allows visitors to click it and return to the top of the page for ease of navigation.

#### Feature 3
_Social Media Icons:_ These are fixed iconsin both the navigation bar and footer. They are opposing colours to catch the attention of customers
The icons are sourced from Font Awesome. They change colour when the mouse hovers over them which creates an engaging customer experience.
The active page is highlighted by a slate gray colour to aid navigation. 

#### Feature 4
_Black and white Image:_
Each page has a black and white image below the navigation bar to convey a positive emotive response from the user.
On each page the signature name of LN Fitness is printed across the image in bright green. Each page benefits from a new image to keep the customer engaged and convey the service provided. 
With responsive design, the image is not shown, however, the signature name is to encourage brand recognition. 

#### Feature 5
_Tailored program link:_ This is located on the 'Home' page and links to the 'Personal Training'
page. It is to attract customers to the promotion of a free consultation and a 
__call to action button__. The word "free" is highlighted to draw attention to the offer. 

#### Feature 6
_Embedded Video:_ Located on the 'Group Training' page. The user can play and pause with a click. With responsive design, this becomes a button that becomes an external page so the user is not taken away from LN Fitness website. 


#### Feature 7
_Get in touch link:_ Link on each page (except home) and a __call to action__ which directs the customer to the Get in Touch page. Located at the end of the page.


#### Feature 8
_Get in touch:_ This is a form, allowing visitors to send their enquiry directly to
the fitness expert. Name, email, contact number and message must be filled. All fields are required
and a valid email address must be used. The bottom of the page contains a Send Button. Included in the form is a box that can be ticked to opt in to emails regarding the latest offers.
This can potentially increase the customer base and allows for effective marketing.

#### Feature 10

#### Fearure 11
_Font and colours_ A transitioning gray to white background was chosen with the text in black.
This was to convey the clean and simple service that is being provided. The colours compliment the black and white photos while highlighting the energetic and vibrancy nature of the navigation bar (yellow), signiture text (bright green) and highlighted text (white or marigold)
which is used to create a healthy vibrancy to the website.
